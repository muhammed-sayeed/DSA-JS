# 📅 Day 5 – Strings

## 🎯 Goal
Understand and implement common string-based problems:
- Palindrome check (basic + valid)
- Anagram problems (pair and grouping)

## 🎯 Concepts

### Palindrome Check
- Use two pointers from start and end.
- Skip non-alphanumeric characters.
- Compare ignoring case.

### Anagrams
- **Sorting** → Convert both strings to sorted form and compare.
- **HashMap** → Count frequency of characters in both strings.

## 📝 Practice Problems

1. **Valid Palindrome** – Check if string is palindrome (ignoring case and non-alphanumerics).
2. **Valid Anagram** – Check if two strings are anagrams.
3. **Group Anagrams** – Group words that are anagrams of each other.
