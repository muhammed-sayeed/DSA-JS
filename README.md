# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in JavaScript

This repository documents my **90-Day DSA Learning Journey**, following a structured roadmap.  
It includes **concept explanations, problems, solutions, and notes** — all implemented in **JavaScript (ES6)**.

## 📅 90-Day DSA Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundations (Week 1–2)**
- Arrays & Strings: reversal, rotation, subarray sums, palindrome, anagrams  
- HashMap/Set basics  
- Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion (concepts) | Quick/Merge (interviews)  
- Binary Search variations: first/last occurrence, floor/ceil, search in rotated array  

### **Phase 2: Array & Pointer Patterns (Week 3–5)**
- Prefix Sum + Hashing  
- Two Pointers (pair sum, 3sum, trapping rain water)  
- Sliding Window (max sum subarray, min window substring)  
- Fast/Slow Pointers (cycle detection, middle node, happy number)  

### **Phase 3: Linked List, Stack & Heap (Week 6–7)**
- Linked List reversal, merge, cycle detection  
- Monotonic Stack (next greater element, largest rectangle)  
- Heap/Priority Queue (top K elements, sliding window max)  

### **Phase 4: Interval + Search Patterns (Week 8)**
- Merge intervals, meeting rooms, insert interval  
- Modified Binary Search problems  

### **Phase 5: Trees & Graphs (Week 9–10)**
- Binary Tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)  
- BFS/DFS on trees & graphs  
- Matrix traversal (islands, rotten oranges, word search)  

### **Phase 6: Backtracking + DP (Week 11–13)**
- Backtracking (subsets, permutations, N-Queens, Sudoku)  
- DP Basics: Fibonacci, climbing stairs, coin change  
- DP on subsequences: LCS, LIS, knapsack  
- Advanced DP: palindromic subsequences, DP on intervals/trees  

### **Extra (If Time Allows)**
- Greedy (activity selection, Huffman coding)  
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find, Kruskal’s)  
- Tries (autocomplete, word break)  
- Bit Manipulation (XOR tricks, bitmask subsets)

Each topic contains:

- **README.md** → Concept explanation with diagrams/notes.  
- **problems.md** → List of practice problems with sources.  
- **solutions.js** → Clean, commented JS code.
